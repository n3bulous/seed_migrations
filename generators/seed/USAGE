Description:
    Creates a new seed data file and optional configuration file for
    ordering. Pass a name for the seed data file, either CamelCased or
    under_scored, as an argument.

    This creates a seed data file in db/seeds and will add an entry to 
    the db/seeds/seed_order.yaml file (and create it if necessary).

Example:
    `./script/generate seed administrator_and_countries`

    creates the seed file and ordering:
        db/seeds
        db/seeds/seed_order.yaml
        db/seeds/20091209014329_administrator_and_countries.rb
